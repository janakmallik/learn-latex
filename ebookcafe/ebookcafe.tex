\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Introduction}
Our project aims to create an online store that provides customers with the option to purchase both physical books and e-books. The goal is to offer a convenient and accessible platform for customers to browse and purchase their desired books in either format. This will help eliminate the need for customers to visit multiple stores or websites to find the books they want, and streamline the purchasing process by offering both formats in one place named “EbookCafe.com”.

The idea of combining physical books and e-books in one platform is a great solution to save both time and energy for people and the planet. In the past, bookstores were the only option for people to purchase physical books, but with the rise of e-books, online bookstores have become more popular. However, having to visit multiple sites to purchase both physical books and e-books can be a hassle for consumers.

By combining physical books and e-books in one platform, consumers can easily compare prices, browse through a wider selection of titles, and conveniently purchase both formats from one location. This will not only save time for consumers, but also reduce the carbon footprint associated with shipping multiple orders from different locations.

In addition, this combined platform could also promote sustainability by offering digital versions of books, reducing the need for paper and shipping materials. This could be especially impactful in regions where access to physical bookstores is limited, or where transportation costs make it difficult for consumers to access physical books.
\subsection{Proposed Goals}
Our project is focused on creating an online store where people have the option to buy or sell both physical books and e-books. The platform will serve as a one-stop-shop for customers looking for their favorite books, whether they prefer to read in print or digitally.

\subsection{Project Accomplishment}
We have completed our physical book selling and buying part, we add all these necessary options for users and admin to deal with a online book store. we implemented feature to add new books with all necessary data needed like name, author name, publisher, category, stock etc.

User can add books to cart, whitelist and then checkout to order which is available for admin to track properly with time date and address etc. \textbf{User can give ratings to books from 1 to 5 and add a review in text.}

We are very satisfied by completing with all these works properly.
\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Thought we have proposed to add e-book facility. Due to lack of time and resources we failed to add E-book facilities. hopefully, we will try to implement all the features to function all about e-books as soon as possible.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Conclusion}
Our project aims to create an online store that provides customers with the option to purchase both physical books and e-books. The goal is to offer a convenient and accessible platform for customers to browse and purchase their desired books in either format. This will help eliminate the need for customers to visit multiple stores or websites to find the books they want, and streamline the purchasing process by offering both formats in one place.
\subsection{Limitations}
Overall limitations we have faced while working on the project.
\begin{description}
    \item[\hspace{7mm}- Time and Resources :] Developing a properly functional and user-friendly online book store require more time and significant resources.
    \item[\hspace{7mm}- Technical Expertise :] Developing an online book store requires technical expertise in website development, e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, and security measures. Lack of technical expertise can lead us to poorly functioning some of the features of our website.
\end{description}
\subsection{Future Work}
Some possible future work for an online book store could include:

\subsection{Ending Remarks}
By providing customers with the option to purchase e-books, we hope to encourage the adoption of digital formats, which can contribute to a more sustainable future by reducing the consumption of paper and the carbon footprint associated with shipping physical books. However, we also recognize that many customers still prefer physical books and we aim to provide them with the option to purchase those as well.

Overall, our online store project aims to provide a comprehensive and convenient solution for customers looking to purchase books in either physical or digital formats, while also contributing to a more sustainable future.
